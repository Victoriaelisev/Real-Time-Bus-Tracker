Real Time Bus Tracker
Welcome to the Real Time Bus Tracker! This program allows you to view the current location and estimated arrival times of buses in your area in real-time. The program is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes data from public transit agencies to provide accurate information.

How to Run
To run the Real Time Bus Tracker, you will need a modern web browser that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox).

To start the program, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The program will automatically display a map of your location, as well as a list of nearby bus stops and their respective arrival times.

You can click on a bus stop to view more information about that particular stop, including its location and a list of arriving buses. The program will update the bus arrival times in real-time, so you can always see the most accurate information.

Roadmap of Future Improvements
Some ideas for future improvements to the Real Time Bus Tracker include:

Adding support for more public transit agencies, to provide information for a wider range of locations
Adding the ability to search for specific bus routes or stops
Integrating with other forms of transportation, such as trains or ride-sharing services
Adding alerts for delays or service disruptions
Improving the user interface for a better user experience
